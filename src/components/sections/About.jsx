            Founded in 1999 by visionary students from the University of Malawi, CAPS is a dynamic non-profit organization committed to eradicating poverty and tackling social challenges across Malawi. We partner with government agencies, civil society, and local communities to empower vulnerable groups through innovative, grassroots-driven initiatives.

            With a focus on health, education, agriculture, environment, and human rights, we've been transforming lives for over two decades, fostering resilience and self-reliance in the face of adversity. Our dedicated team of 10 volunteers works tirelessly to create lasting change, drawing inspiration from successful models like World Vision Malawi's extensive child sponsorship programs and CARE's community empowerment strategies.
